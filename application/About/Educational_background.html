                            I started my education at La Trinidad Academy, where I attended preschool. It was a time filled with 
                            curiosity, learning through play, and building early social skills. This stage helped me become more 
                            confident and prepared me for formal schooling. It played an important role in shaping my mindset 
                            toward education and my eagerness to keep exploring new things.

                            I studied at Jesus Good Shepherd School for grade school, where I built a strong academic foundation.

                            I also learned the value of discipline and responsibility, both in and out of the classroom—lessons 
                            that helped guide me into higher education.

                            From Junior High to College, I studied at De La Salle University - Dasmariñas. I took the CSS track in 
                            Junior High and the STEM strand in Senior High. I graduated in July 2025 with a BS in Information
